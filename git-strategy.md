# Git Workflow Strategy

## Branching Strategy

### Main Branches
- **main**: The stable branch containing production-ready code. All releases are tagged here.
- **develop**: The integration branch for features and bug fixes. This is where the latest development happens.

### Supporting Branches
- **feature/\<feature-name\>**: Branches for new features. Created from `develop` and merged back into `develop`.
- **bugfix/\<bugfix-name\>**: Branches for bug fixes. Created from `develop` and merged back into `develop`.
- **release/\<version-number\>**: Branches for preparing a new production release. Created from `develop` and merged into `main` and `develop`.
- **hotfix/\<hotfix-name\>**: Branches for urgent fixes in production. Created from `main` and merged back into `main` and `develop`.

## Rules

### Branch Creation
- Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., `feature/login-page`, `bugfix/header-issue`).
- Prefix branches appropriately (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `release/`, `hotfix/`).

### Commits
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Use the imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add login functionality").
- Group related changes into a single commit.

### Pull Requests
- Create pull requests for merging branches.
- Ensure pull requests are reviewed by at least one other team member.
- Address feedback and make necessary changes before merging.

### Merging
- Use fast-forward or squash merging for feature and bugfix branches.
- Use merge commits for release and hotfix branches.

### Code Reviews
- Conduct code reviews for all pull requests.
- Check for code quality, adherence to coding standards, and potential issues.

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass before merging branches.

### Documentation
- Update documentation for new features and changes.
- Maintain a changelog for releases.

## Workflow Example

1. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/login-page develop`
2. **Develop the feature**: Make commits to the `feature/login-page` branch.
3. **Push the branch**: `git push origin feature/login-page`
4. **Create a pull request**: Merge `feature/login-page` into `develop`.
5. **Review and merge**: Conduct code review, address feedback, and merge the pull request.
6. **Prepare for release**: Create a `release/1.0.0` branch from `develop`.
7. **Finalize and merge**: Merge `release/1.0.0` into `main` and `develop`.
8. **Hotfix if needed**: Create a `hotfix/critical-bug` branch from `main`, fix the issue, and merge back into `main` and `develop`.

By following this strategy, you can maintain a clean and organized Git repository, ensuring smooth collaboration and efficient development processes. If you have any specific requirements or adjustments, feel free to let me know! ðŸ˜Š
